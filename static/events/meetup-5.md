      In the age of internet paradigm-shift children’s toys and games are
      changing as well as the toolkit of education.


      [Andrea](http://andreagorcz.herokuapp.com/) has a rare condition, called
      synaesthesia. It means that the production of a sense impression is
      relating and stimulating another sense impression in her brain.
      Recognising it made her learning process much more effective. This
      phenomenon inspired her to transition from graphic designer to a media
      artist and to do research on the topic of multi-sensorial learning
      techniques.


      She will talk about how to implement technology in education in a good
      manner and how digital interfaces are effecting our cognitive-system.

Hey!

This will be our fifth community meetup! (well, if we don't count the previous two meetups, but they didn't have any numbers in their title :) ) 

What to expect?

- nice, open and curious people
- 3 short talks to feed our brains with some new inspiration
- hanging out, getting to know each other, maybe making up future plans for  collaborations or exhibitions together.

We are all looking forward to seeing you!
