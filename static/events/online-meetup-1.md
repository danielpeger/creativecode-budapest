      And the second presentation will be by Samu Setényi. He is from XORXOR,
      works with new technology to make art and design works that continue the
      tradition of human expression and craftsmanship in a meaningful way. Samu
      will introduce us to Mestometer, which is a project initiated and designed
      by Samuel Velebný to make a digital interactive installation that
      simulates the decision-making processes of urban economies.\
