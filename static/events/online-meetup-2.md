      Afterwards the collective Safe Space will present their project Remnants:
      Kind Acts of Cruelty.\

      Safe Space is a collective of Creative Technologies students from Film
      University Babelsberg and our close circle. They are all wandering around
      the intersection of media, art and technology, and our complementary
      skills and interests in making a friendlier world bond us together.\

      Remnants is an installation that visualises microaggressions and make them
      perceptible for non-marginalized people, to raise awareness for everyday
      racism and help dismantle racism in our society.\

This is going to be our second online meetup!



This time we will have two inspiring talks, and afterwards we can hang out in the online space if we feel like.
