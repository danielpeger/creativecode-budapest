      Our first speaker will be Paul Oomen, the founder of 4D Sound. Paul was
      born in Amsterdam, he is a composer, curator and technologist. From an
      early age on he gathered experience in theatre as an actor and director,
      and as a musician skilled in percussion, piano and singing. He specialised
      himself initially as a composer of music for theatre and opera, before he
      turned to work exclusively on the investigation of space, sound and
      perception within the context of 4DSOUND.

      As Head of Development at the Spatial Sound Institute, he supports
      artistic practice and research at the Institute, driven by his vision on
      the development of spatial sound as a new medium.

      In photography the focus of his interest is error aesthetics by managing
      adverse events both in designing and imaging phases. The research field he
      is currently working on is questioning the objective reality from art
      history, photographic, philosophical and physical perspective as well. He
      is committed to the multi-disciplinary art direction as he thinks there is
      no strong borderline exist between science and art for instance.

      Nowadays he is using medical imaging modalities (in his latest project
      combined with 3D printing) for photography.

      He is searching for and trying to push the limits of post-photography,
      however he frequently use analogue instant techniques as
      well.[https://www.zoltanvadaszi.com/](https://www.zoltanvadaszi.com/
